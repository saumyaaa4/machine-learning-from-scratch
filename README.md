## 🔹 Algorithms Included

1. **Linear Regression**  
   Predicts continuous values based on input features. Example: House price prediction.  
   [`linear_regression.py`](linear_regression.py)

2. **Logistic Regression**  
   Predicts binary outcomes (0/1). Example: Customer purchase prediction.  
   [`logistic_regression.py`](logistic_regression.py)

3. **Decision Tree**  
   Classifies data by splitting features into branches. Example: Animal classification.  
   [`decision_tree.py`](decision_tree.py)

4. **Random Forest**  
   Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy. Example: Customer churn prediction.  
   [`random_forest.py`](random_forest.py)

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   Classifies data based on the majority of nearest neighbors. Example: Product recommendation.  
   [`knn.py`](knn.py)

6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   Finds the best boundary to separate classes. Example: Spam email detection.  
   [`svm.py`](svm.py)

7. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   Reduces dimensions while keeping most of the information. Example: Visualizing high-dimensional data.  
   [`pca.py`](pca.py)

8. **K-Means Clustering**  
   Groups data points into clusters based on similarity. Example: Customer segmentation.  
   [`k_means.py`](k_means.py)

9. **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
   Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem. Example: Spam email detection.  
   [`naive_bayes.py`](naive_bayes.py)
